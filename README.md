# Fruit-Freshness-Grading-Using-Deep-Learning

This project aims to develop a system that can analyze and grade the freshness of fruits through a deep learning model. As fruits have significant importance in our economy and health, it opens up a vast opportunity to develop such kind of system that can evaluate fruit freshness. For evaluating the freshness, we consider the outer part of fruits. By considering the outer texture of the fruit we feed our model a number of images of a specific fruit with two conditions- Fresh and Rotten. The model trains itself accordingly and after training, we get to predict a given fruit whether it is a fresh or rotten one. This system gives us a result based on the class that it has predicted.
